Notion - for organizing notes

1. Spring manages beans, but abstraction level is our responsibility. We are responsible creating all the packages.

2. Maven is not Intellij's product, is standalone and helps us to manage project, adding some feature, dependencies and etc.

3. two different way to wire, inject objects = pass as parameter in the method, another provide as method inside new DellCase;

4. Default name when we use @Qualifier is the class name, starting with lower character and then Camel Case structure.
