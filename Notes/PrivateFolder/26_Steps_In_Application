1. User Request
LocalHost:8080/user/create

2. Controller

@Controller
@RequestMapping
public class UserController {

}

How Java decides which controller request need to call?
We need to find endPoint and then it will find the controller.

3. Injection in Controller
What's the point of Injection?
We want to access methods of injected class.
Also, Spring can manage and create beans and inject when needed.

3. DTO
Model parameter = if you want pass any data to pass to UI side, we need special structure. By using Model interface I can pass my data to view or DB.
