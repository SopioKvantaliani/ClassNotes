Fork a project:
    Forking means a way to get a copy for myself on my remote repository. I can make any changes in the copy and it won't affect
    the original file.
    1. open project and find fork button on the right side
    2. click and create copy of the project. It will be your local and won't gonna affect the original file.

Git Branching strategy:
    1. Master Branch - main branch of the codebase that contains the production ready code.
    2. Develop Branch - is used as a staging area for changes that are not yet production-ready. When a new feature or bug fix is
                        added to the codebase, it is first merged into the develop branch.
    3. Feature branches  - are used to develop new features or make changes to existing functionality in isolation from the main codebase.
                           Each feature or bug fix is developed on its own feature branch and then merged back into the develop
                           branch once it is complete.

Rebase
    Similar to merging, but it handles the commits differently, rearranges the order of commits.
